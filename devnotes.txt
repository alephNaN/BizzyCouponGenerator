- Want to write code to abstract out the particular ECommerce platform. 
  Support Shopify, and others.
- Need test Shopify account to verify discount code creation
- shopify.php currently does not correctly error handle the caller of the API passing in an invalid shop name. 
  The code thinks it's able to successfully login, and runs into problem when actually trying to interface with Shopify' internal API
- Ran into problem running the code on a Windows computer with LAMP stack with a different curl configuration / installation  than uploading to my linux box
- Ran into a problem where going to the backend service, would be redirected to shopify or prompted for login by shopify. Cannot / do not remember how to reproduce. Clearing the browser cookies, and restarting chrome fixed this. This is where I wasted an hour.
