Research (12:30-1:30PM)
	- Experimented with: https://github.com/MartinAmps/Shopify-Private-APIs/blob/master/shopify.php
	- What the code is doing:
		(1) logins to Shopify with a user's username and password
 		(2) Makes do request at the discount creation page with appropriate parameters
 	- Notes:
 		Relies on CURL. Problem with Curl on my Windows LAMP stack. Upload to Linux box, works.
